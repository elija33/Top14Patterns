# Top14Patterns

Whenever you are asked to find a certain element in a sorted array, linked list or matrix, the best algorithm you can use is binary search. Modified binary search is a more efficient way to handle these problems.

                                How to identify the modified binary search pattern
You can use the modified binary search pattern to solve order-agnostic binary search or search in a sorted infinite array problems.
