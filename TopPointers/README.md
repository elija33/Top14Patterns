# Top14Patterns
The two-pointers pattern includes two pointers which iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition. Two pointers is often useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list, like when you have to compare each element of an array to its other elements.

With one pointer, you would have to continually loop back through the array to find the answer. The back and forth with a single iterator is inefficient for time and space complexity—a concept referred to as asymptotic analysis. While the brute force or naive solution with one pointer would work, it will produce something like O(n²). In many cases, two pointers can help you solve the problem with better space or run-time complexity.
