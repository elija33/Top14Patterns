The sliding window pattern is used to perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list, such as finding the longest subarray containing all 1s. Sliding windows start from the first element and keep shifting right by one element. Adjust the length of the window to meet the criteria in your coding interview. The window size can grow, shrink or stay constant.
